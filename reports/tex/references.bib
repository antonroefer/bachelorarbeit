	abstract = {Understanding the landscape evolution and human-environmental interaction within it is one of the key tasks of early Holocene research. As mobile hunter–gatherers leave few traces of structural organization, understanding their habitats is relevant for comprehending these people. Rarely does the spatial distribution of artifacts correspond to the real pattern of past human activity, but rather shows the pattern of identified artifacts. Geophysical investigations try to fill this gap and have been applied increasingly in archaeological prospection delivering landscape reconstruction, which are verified and fine-tuned using corings and excavations. Despite promising 3D models, a tool to predict the location of undiscovered former human presence and the conditions which influenced people to move across the landscape is not well developed. The primary goal of this paper is to present a methodology for connecting spatial patterns of past human activity based on archaeological and geophysical data. We discuss different {GPR} (ground-penetrating radar) facies classified at the shoreline of the former Lake Duvensee and geomorphological variables, which leads to the possibility of understanding where and why people chose preferred areas to settle on former islands. We also demonstrate that Mesolithic hunter–gatherer groups preferred dry areas with access to open water for short-term campsites and flatter and more protected areas for specialized and repeatedly occupied campsites. The cardinal orientation of a campsite seems to be secondary to the local peat over-growing process and access to water.},

	abstract = {Interpretation of seismic reflection data routinely involves powerful multiple-central-processing-unit computers, advanced visualization techniques, and generation of numerous seismic data types and attributes. Even with these technologies at the disposal of interpreters, there are additional techniques to derive even more useful information from our data. Over the last few years, there have been efforts to distill numerous seismic attributes into volumes that are easily evaluated for their geologic significance and improved seismic interpretation. Seismic attributes are any measurable property of seismic data. Commonly used categories of seismic attributes include instantaneous, geometric, amplitude accentuating, amplitude-variation with offset, spectral decomposition, and inversion. Principal component analysis ({PCA}), a linear quantitative technique, has proven to be an excellent approach for use in understanding which seismic attributes or combination of seismic attributes has interpretive significance. The {PCA} reduces a large set of seismic attributes to indicate variations in the data, which often relate to geologic features of interest. {PCA}, as a tool used in an interpretation workflow, can help to determine meaningful seismic attributes. In turn, these attributes are input to self-organizing-map ({SOM}) training. The {SOM}, a form of unsupervised neural networks, has proven to take many of these seismic attributes and produce meaningful and easily interpretable results. {SOM} analysis reveals the natural clustering and patterns in data and has been beneficial in defining stratigraphy, seismic facies, direct hydrocarbon indicator features, and aspects of shale plays, such as fault/fracture trends and sweet spots. With modern visualization capabilities and the application of 2D color maps, {SOM} routinely identifies meaningful geologic patterns. Recent work using {SOM} and {PCA} has revealed geologic features that were not previously identified or easily interpreted from the seismic data. The ultimate goal in this multiattribute analysis is to enable the geoscientist to produce a more accurate interpretation and reduce exploration and development risk.},

However, there exist situations in which, despite the presence of buried archaeological remains, hardly any corresponding anomalies can be observed in the {GPR} time- or depth-slice amplitude images.

            The prediction of highly heterogeneous reservoir parameters from seismic amplitude data is a major challenge. Seismic attribute analysis can enhance the tracking of subtle stratigraphic features. It is challenging to investigate these subtle features, including channel systems, with conventional-amplitude seismic data. Over the past few years, the use of machine learning ({ML}) to analyze multiple seismic attributes has enhanced the facies analysis by mapping patterns in seismic data. The purpose of this research was to assess the efficiency of an unsupervised self-organizing map ({SOM}) approach supported by multi-attribute analysis that could improve gas channel detection and seismic facies classification in Serpent Field, offshore Nile Delta, Egypt. As well as evaluates the importance of several available seismic attributes in reservoir characterization rather than analyzing individual attribute volumes. In this study, the single attribute (spectral decomposition attribute) highlighted the gas channel spatial distribution using three distinct frequency magnitude values. Subsequently, we employ principal component analysis ({PCA}) as an attribute selection method, discovering that combining seismic attributes such as sweetness, envelope, spectral magnitude, and spectral voice as input for {SOM} reflects an effective method to determine facies. The clustering results distinguish between shale, shaly sand, wet sand, and gas-saturated sand and identify gas–water contact on a 2D topological map ({SOM}), where each pattern indicates certain facies. This is achieved by associating the {SOM} outputs with lithofacies determined from petrophysical logs. Reducing exploration and development risk and empowering the geoscientist to generate a more precise interpretation are the ultimate objectives of this multi-attribute analysis.},

	abstract = {Seismic volumetric dip and azimuth are widely used in assisting seismic interpretation to depict geologic structures such as chaotic slumps, fans, faults, and unconformities. Current popular dip and azimuth estimation methods include the semblance-based multiple window scanning ({MWS}) method and gradient structure tensor ({GST}) analysis. However, the dip estimation accuracy using the semblance scanning method is affected by the dip of seismic reflectors. The dip estimation accuracy using the {GST} analysis is affected by the analysis window centered at the analysis point. We have developed a new algorithm to overcome the disadvantages of dip estimation using {MWS} and {GST} analysis by combining and improving the two methods. The algorithm first obtains an estimated “rough” dip and azimuth for reflectors using the semblance scanning method. Then, the algorithm defines a window that is “roughly” parallel to the local reflectors using the estimated rough dip and azimuth. The algorithm next estimates the dip and azimuth of the reflectors within the analysis window using {GST} analysis. To improve the robustness of {GST} analysis to noise, we used analytic seismic traces to compute the {GST} matrix. The algorithm finally uses the Kuwahara window strategy to determine the dip and azimuth of local reflectors. To illustrate the superiority of this algorithm, we applied it to the F3 block poststack seismic data acquired in the North Sea, Netherlands. The comparison indicates that the seismic volumetric dips estimated using our method more accurately follow the local seismic reflectors than the dips computed using {GST} analysis and the semblance-based {MWS} method.},

By removing the seismic wavelet from the data, seismic coherence offers interpreters a different perspective, often exposing subtle features not readily apparent in the seismic data. Several formulations exist for obtaining coherence estimates. The first three generations of coherence algorithms at Amoco are based, respectively, on cross correlation, semblance, and an eigendecomposition of the data covariance matrix. Application of these three generations to data from the Gulf of Mexico indicates that the implementation of the eigenstructure approach described in this paper produces the most robust results. This paper first introduces the basic eigenstructure approach for computing coherence followed by a comparison on data from the Gulf of Mexico. Next, Appendix A develops a theoretical connection between the well-known semblance and the less well-known eigenstructure measures of coherence in terms of the eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix.

	abstract = {Interpreters face two main challenges in seismic facies analysis. The first challenge is to define, or “label,” the facies of interest. The second challenge is to select a suite of attributes that can differentiate a target facies from the background reflectivity. Our key objective is to determine which seismic attributes can best differentiate one class of chaotic seismic facies from another using modern machine-learning technology. Although simple 1D histograms provide a list of candidate attributes, they do not provide insight into the optimum number or combination of attributes. To address this limitation, we have conducted an exhaustive search whereby we represent the target and background training facies by high-dimensional Gaussian mixture models ({GMMs}) for each potential attribute combination. The first step is to choose candidate attributes that may be able to differentiate chaotic mass-transport deposits and salt diapirs from the more conformal, coherent background reflectors. The second step is to draw polygons around the target and background facies to provide the labeled data to be represented by {GMMs}. Maximizing the distance between all {GMM} facies pairs provides the optimum number and combination of attributes. We use generative topographic mapping to represent the high-dimensional attribute data by a lower dimensional 2D manifold. Each labeled facies provides a probability density function on the manifold that can be compared to the probability density function of each voxel, providing the likelihood that a given voxel is a member of each of the facies. Our first example maps chaotic seismic facies associated with the development of salt diapirs and minibasins. Our second example successfully delineates karst collapse underlying a shale resource play from north Texas.},

Our basic understanding of earthquake processes and our ability to resolve 4D Earth structure are fundamentally limited by data volume. Today, Big Data Seismology is an emergent revolution involving the use of large, data‐dense inquiries that is providing new opportunities to make fundamental advances in these areas. This article reviews recent scientific advances enabled by Big Data Seismology through the context of three major drivers: the development of new data‐dense sensor systems, improvements in computing, and the development of new types of techniques and algorithms. Each driver is explored in the context of both global and exploration seismology, alongside collaborative opportunities that combine the features of long‐duration data collections (common to global seismology) with dense networks of sensors (common to exploration seismology). The review explores some of the unique challenges and opportunities that Big Data Seismology presents, drawing on parallels from other fields facing similar issues. Finally, recent scientific findings enabled by dense seismic data sets are discussed, and we assess the opportunities for significant advances made possible with Big Data Seismology.

The integration of fluid-related attributes such as Scaled Poisson Reflectivity ({SPR}) and {AVO} Gradient, the predicted Gamma Ray, and the high density detected faults combined with the gas chimneys probability cube helped find new prospects in the area. They also helped assess the risk of the prospects and order them in terms of their associated geological risk.},

However, 3D seismic survey are often limited in size (at most {\textasciitilde}100-km-long), thus insufficient for regional mapping of features that are hundreds to thousands of km in length. Such 3D surveys are often accompanied by previously acquired 2D regional lines. Yet, due to the 2D nature and older acquisition technique, these 2D lines are usually of lower quality and contain more noise than the associated 3D data. In this project, we improve seismic image quality, identify regional features and local anomalies, and analyze seismic facies that are potentially related to hydrocarbon production in the Exmouth Plateau, North Carnarvon Basin, Australia, by simultaneously applying data conditioning, seismic attribute calculation, and Self-Organizing-Map ({SOM}) classification to multiple vintage 2D lines.

	abstract = {{AbstractDuring} the past decade, the size of 3D seismic data volumes and the number of seismic attributes have increased to the extent that it is difficult, if not impossible, for interpreters to examine every seismic line and time slice. To address this problem, several seismic facies classification algorithms including k-means, self-organizing maps, generative topographic mapping, support vector machines, Gaussian mixture models, and artificial neural networks have been successfully used to extract features of geologic interest from multiple volumes. Although well documented in the literature, the terminology and complexity of these algorithms may bewilder the average seismic interpreter, and few papers have applied these competing methods to the same data volume. We have reviewed six commonly used algorithms and applied them to a single 3D seismic data volume acquired over the Canterbury Basin, offshore New Zealand, where one of the main objectives was to differentiate the architectural elements of a tu...},

	doi = {10.1190/int-2016-0132.1},
	abstract = {{AbstractPattern} recognition-based seismic facies analysis techniques are commonly used in modern quantitative seismic interpretation. However, interpreters often treat techniques such as artificial neural networks and self-organizing maps ({SOMs}) as a “black box” that somehow correlates a suite of attributes to a desired geomorphological or geomechanical facies. Even when the statistical correlations are good, the inability to explain such correlations through principles of geology or physics results in suspicion of the results. The most common multiattribute facies analysis begins by correlating a suite of candidate attributes to a desired output, keeping those that correlate best for subsequent analysis. The analysis then takes place in attribute space rather than (x, y, and z) space, removing spatial trends often observed by interpreters. We add a stratigraphy layering component to a {SOM} model that attempts to preserve the intersample relation along the vertical axis. Specifically, we use a mode decompo...},

	doi = {10.1007/s00024-021-02916-7},
	abstract = {The temporal and spatial distribution of seismic activity is analyzed using a self-organizing map ({SOM}) to find the relation between large, hazardous and other, smaller earthquakes. The seismic activity is represented by the number of shallow earthquakes with magnitude greater than 1.0 that are counted in lists of hypocenters every 3 months for suitably divided spatial segments of the Tohoku and Kanto areas in northern and central Japan, respectively. The input vector of the {SOM}, consisting of the spatial distribution of seismic activity, is assigned to each time interval and given a label that specifies the time relative to the occurrence of large earthquakes. Unsupervised learning of the {SOM} produces a two-dimensional map that can separate the input vectors into active and inactive seismic periods. Since an active period begins with a precursory stage preceding large earthquakes, the possible occurrence of a large earthquake can be predicted by identifying the current state of the seismic activity as either an active or inactive period in the {SOM}.},

The Self-Organizing Map ({SOM}) algorithm was introduced by the author in 1981. Its theory and many applications form one of the major approaches to the contemporary artificial neural networks field, and new technologies have already been based on it. The most important practical applications are in exploratory data analysis, pattern recognition, speech analysis, robotics, industrial and medical diagnostics, instrumentation, and control, and literally hundreds of other tasks. In this monograph the mathematical preliminaries, background, basic ideas, and implications are expounded in a clear, well-organized form, accessible without prior expert knowledge. Still the contents are handled with theoretical rigor.},

These {RGB} components can be defined mathematically in terms of hue, lightness, and saturation ({HLS}) components. A fourth alpha-blending (also called opacity) component provides a means to corender multiple images. Most, but not all, modern commercial interpretation workstation software vendors provide multiattribute display tools using an opacity model. A smaller subset of vendors provide tools to interactively display two or three attributes using {HLS}, {CMY}, and {RGB} color models. I evaluated a technique (or trick) to simulate the {HLS} color model using monochromatic color bars and only opacity. This same trick only approximates true color blending of {RGB} or {CMY} components. There are three basic objectives in choosing which attributes to display together. The first objective is to understand the correlation of one attribute to another, and most commonly, of a given attribute to the original seismic amplitude data. The...},
