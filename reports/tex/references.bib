	abstract = {Interpreters face two main challenges in seismic facies analysis. The first challenge is to define, or “label,” the facies of interest. The second challenge is to select a suite of attributes that can differentiate a target facies from the background reflectivity. Our key objective is to determine which seismic attributes can best differentiate one class of chaotic seismic facies from another using modern machine-learning technology. Although simple 1D histograms provide a list of candidate attributes, they do not provide insight into the optimum number or combination of attributes. To address this limitation, we have conducted an exhaustive search whereby we represent the target and background training facies by high-dimensional Gaussian mixture models ({GMMs}) for each potential attribute combination. The first step is to choose candidate attributes that may be able to differentiate chaotic mass-transport deposits and salt diapirs from the more conformal, coherent background reflectors. The second step is to draw polygons around the target and background facies to provide the labeled data to be represented by {GMMs}. Maximizing the distance between all {GMM} facies pairs provides the optimum number and combination of attributes. We use generative topographic mapping to represent the high-dimensional attribute data by a lower dimensional 2D manifold. Each labeled facies provides a probability density function on the manifold that can be compared to the probability density function of each voxel, providing the likelihood that a given voxel is a member of each of the facies. Our first example maps chaotic seismic facies associated with the development of salt diapirs and minibasins. Our second example successfully delineates karst collapse underlying a shale resource play from north Texas.},

By removing the seismic wavelet from the data, seismic coherence offers interpreters a different perspective, often exposing subtle features not readily apparent in the seismic data. Several formulations exist for obtaining coherence estimates. The first three generations of coherence algorithms at Amoco are based, respectively, on cross correlation, semblance, and an eigendecomposition of the data covariance matrix. Application of these three generations to data from the Gulf of Mexico indicates that the implementation of the eigenstructure approach described in this paper produces the most robust results. This paper first introduces the basic eigenstructure approach for computing coherence followed by a comparison on data from the Gulf of Mexico. Next, Appendix A develops a theoretical connection between the well-known semblance and the less well-known eigenstructure measures of coherence in terms of the eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix. Appendix B further extends the analysis by comparing the semblance- and eigenstructure-based coherence measures in the presence of additive uncorrelated noise.},

	abstract = {Seismic volumetric dip and azimuth are widely used in assisting seismic interpretation to depict geologic structures such as chaotic slumps, fans, faults, and unconformities. Current popular dip and azimuth estimation methods include the semblance-based multiple window scanning ({MWS}) method and gradient structure tensor ({GST}) analysis. However, the dip estimation accuracy using the semblance scanning method is affected by the dip of seismic reflectors. The dip estimation accuracy using the {GST} analysis is affected by the analysis window centered at the analysis point. We have developed a new algorithm to overcome the disadvantages of dip estimation using {MWS} and {GST} analysis by combining and improving the two methods. The algorithm first obtains an estimated “rough” dip and azimuth for reflectors using the semblance scanning method. Then, the algorithm defines a window that is “roughly” parallel to the local reflectors using the estimated rough dip and azimuth. The algorithm next estimates the dip and azimuth of the reflectors within the analysis window using {GST} analysis. To improve the robustness of {GST} analysis to noise, we used analytic seismic traces to compute the {GST} matrix. The algorithm finally uses the Kuwahara window strategy to determine the dip and azimuth of local reflectors. To illustrate the superiority of this algorithm, we applied it to the F3 block poststack seismic data acquired in the North Sea, Netherlands. The comparison indicates that the seismic volumetric dips estimated using our method more accurately follow the local seismic reflectors than the dips computed using {GST} analysis and the semblance-based {MWS} method.},

            The prediction of highly heterogeneous reservoir parameters from seismic amplitude data is a major challenge. Seismic attribute analysis can enhance the tracking of subtle stratigraphic features. It is challenging to investigate these subtle features, including channel systems, with conventional-amplitude seismic data. Over the past few years, the use of machine learning ({ML}) to analyze multiple seismic attributes has enhanced the facies analysis by mapping patterns in seismic data. The purpose of this research was to assess the efficiency of an unsupervised self-organizing map ({SOM}) approach supported by multi-attribute analysis that could improve gas channel detection and seismic facies classification in Serpent Field, offshore Nile Delta, Egypt. As well as evaluates the importance of several available seismic attributes in reservoir characterization rather than analyzing individual attribute volumes. In this study, the single attribute (spectral decomposition attribute) highlighted the gas channel spatial distribution using three distinct frequency magnitude values. Subsequently, we employ principal component analysis ({PCA}) as an attribute selection method, discovering that combining seismic attributes such as sweetness, envelope, spectral magnitude, and spectral voice as input for {SOM} reflects an effective method to determine facies. The clustering results distinguish between shale, shaly sand, wet sand, and gas-saturated sand and identify gas–water contact on a 2D topological map ({SOM}), where each pattern indicates certain facies. This is achieved by associating the {SOM} outputs with lithofacies determined from petrophysical logs. Reducing exploration and development risk and empowering the geoscientist to generate a more precise interpretation are the ultimate objectives of this multi-attribute analysis.},

Current {GPR} data visualisations almost exclusively focus on the imaging of {GPR} reflection amplitudes. Ideally, the resulting amplitude maps show subsurface structures of archaeological interest in plan view. However, there exist situations in which, despite the presence of buried archaeological remains, hardly any corresponding anomalies can be observed in the {GPR} time- or depth-slice amplitude images. Following the promising examples set by seismic attribute analysis in the field of exploration seismology, it should be possible to exploit other attributes than merely amplitude values for the enhanced imaging of subsurface structures expressed in {GPR} data. Coherence is the seismic attribute that is a measure for the discontinuity between adjacent traces in post-stack seismic data volumes. Seismic coherence analysis is directly transferable to common high-resolution 3D {GPR} data sets. We demonstrate, how under the right circumstances, trace discontinuity analysis can substantially enhance the imaging of structural information contained in {GPR} data. In certain cases, considerably improved data visualisations are achievable, facilitating subsequent data interpretation. We present {GPR} trace coherence imaging examples taken from extensive, high-resolution archaeological prospection {GPR} data sets.},

	abstract = {Interpretation of seismic reflection data routinely involves powerful multiple-central-processing-unit computers, advanced visualization techniques, and generation of numerous seismic data types and attributes. Even with these technologies at the disposal of interpreters, there are additional techniques to derive even more useful information from our data. Over the last few years, there have been efforts to distill numerous seismic attributes into volumes that are easily evaluated for their geologic significance and improved seismic interpretation. Seismic attributes are any measurable property of seismic data. Commonly used categories of seismic attributes include instantaneous, geometric, amplitude accentuating, amplitude-variation with offset, spectral decomposition, and inversion. Principal component analysis ({PCA}), a linear quantitative technique, has proven to be an excellent approach for use in understanding which seismic attributes or combination of seismic attributes has interpretive significance. The {PCA} reduces a large set of seismic attributes to indicate variations in the data, which often relate to geologic features of interest. {PCA}, as a tool used in an interpretation workflow, can help to determine meaningful seismic attributes. In turn, these attributes are input to self-organizing-map ({SOM}) training. The {SOM}, a form of unsupervised neural networks, has proven to take many of these seismic attributes and produce meaningful and easily interpretable results. {SOM} analysis reveals the natural clustering and patterns in data and has been beneficial in defining stratigraphy, seismic facies, direct hydrocarbon indicator features, and aspects of shale plays, such as fault/fracture trends and sweet spots. With modern visualization capabilities and the application of 2D color maps, {SOM} routinely identifies meaningful geologic patterns. Recent work using {SOM} and {PCA} has revealed geologic features that were not previously identified or easily interpreted from the seismic data. The ultimate goal in this multiattribute analysis is to enable the geoscientist to produce a more accurate interpretation and reduce exploration and development risk.},

	abstract = {Understanding the landscape evolution and human-environmental interaction within it is one of the key tasks of early Holocene research. As mobile hunter–gatherers leave few traces of structural organization, understanding their habitats is relevant for comprehending these people. Rarely does the spatial distribution of artifacts correspond to the real pattern of past human activity, but rather shows the pattern of identified artifacts. Geophysical investigations try to fill this gap and have been applied increasingly in archaeological prospection delivering landscape reconstruction, which are verified and fine-tuned using corings and excavations. Despite promising 3D models, a tool to predict the location of undiscovered former human presence and the conditions which influenced people to move across the landscape is not well developed. The primary goal of this paper is to present a methodology for connecting spatial patterns of past human activity based on archaeological and geophysical data. We discuss different {GPR} (ground-penetrating radar) facies classified at the shoreline of the former Lake Duvensee and geomorphological variables, which leads to the possibility of understanding where and why people chose preferred areas to settle on former islands. We also demonstrate that Mesolithic hunter–gatherer groups preferred dry areas with access to open water for short-term campsites and flatter and more protected areas for specialized and repeatedly occupied campsites. The cardinal orientation of a campsite seems to be secondary to the local peat over-growing process and access to water.},
